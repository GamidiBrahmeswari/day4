        </p>Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC.
        Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
        dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White
        turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and
        distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers
        of the criminal underworld. Breaking Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and concluded on September 29,
        2013, after five seasons consisting of 62 episodes.

        Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy
        Brandt and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob
        Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike
        Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the
        criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive.</p>
